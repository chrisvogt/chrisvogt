### 👋 Hi, I'm [Chris Vogt](https://www.chrisvogt.me)

Software engineer at [GoDaddy](https://github.com/godaddy) in San Francisco. I've been building and rebuilding my personal site for about 12 years now — it started as a small PHP site and I've rewritten it... more times than I'll admit. Right now it's a GatsbyJS + React app backed by Firebase that pulls in what I'm listening to (Spotify), reading (Goodreads), playing (Steam), and working on (GitHub). It's part blog, part dashboard, part playground.

I play piano — mostly jazz standards and covers. I'm not great, but I get lost in it — and I post recordings [on my site](https://www.chrisvogt.me/music/) sometimes. I aspire to record and share that more often. When I'm not at work or at the piano, I'm usually out somewhere and taking a bunch of photos, which I share most often on Instagram Stories.
